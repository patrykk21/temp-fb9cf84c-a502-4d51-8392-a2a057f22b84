# Test project for interview

This project has a [script file](lib/script.rb) with various methods to satisfy the exercise.

I provided 2 versions for each exercise as I didn't know how much performance is important in this context.

## Test

You can find unit tests in [here](spec/script_spec.rb).

To run the tests 
```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

## To run manually

You can modify the [entry file](file.rb) and run whatever method from the `Script` class you prefer.
